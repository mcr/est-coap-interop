The client Root and Intermediate CAs for the Cisco clients are 
Root CA(eccroot.pem): https://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/eccroot.pem
Intermediate CA(sudi-ca.pem): https://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/ACT2ECCSUDI.pem 

Please note you need to trust both in the server, because the client will not send the intermediate CA cert.
