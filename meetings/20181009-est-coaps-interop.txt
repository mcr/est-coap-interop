Thomas Werner: introduced by Panos.
   working with Oscar, Oliver at Fairhair Alliance.
   server side component for domain registrar.
   HTTP + COAP, COAP-EST, also for BRSKI.

Wish to exchange a basic certificate for trust establishment. and doing the initial enrolment.

NEXUS has some trust anchors to exchange.

Trust anchors can be imported by all.
Exhange IdevID
Each reponsible for generating IdevID and produce certificate as shared TA.

1) share trust anchors for IDevID.
2) have "allow all" policy for server side policy.
3) 

IPv4 vs IPv6?  Instance hosted on AWS, only supports IPv4.
  RISE SICS talks IPv6, Nexus talks IPv4, we have solved it through:
  https://jool.mx/en/documentation.html
  
Test cases with delays.  http://www.sandelman.ca/tmp/interop-spec-est-coaps.html

Set up a Google Sheets page with X x Y list of test cases X end-points, and we can mark columns/rows as not yet implemented.

Discussion on: should we assume that coaps-paths _always_ contain the ".well-known"-prefix?

/.well-known/est/sen  -> maps to: /e/sen



Discovery will be at: "/.well-known/core" -OK
e.g.: the simpleenroll endpoint will be:  
    Option 1) "/.well-known/est/sen"   ---> Option 1 is preferred for the beginning of interOp
    Option 2) "/est/sen" 


Oct. 16: next meeting.
Oct. 23: third meeting.

Q1: Fix a number of examples that should be POST rather than GET.

Q2: Got impression that everything was CBOR encapsulated... 
  No, just multipart reply for server generated key.
